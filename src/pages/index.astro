    <h2>Professional</h2>

    <p>Hi, my name is Nikolaus Brunner. Most people call me Nik.</p>

    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2020, I am employed as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://bike.center"
        >DealerCenter Digital</a
      >. Although my primary area of focus is Frontend, I also handle Backend related tasks, lead
      projects and mentor colleagues.
    </p>

    <h2>Past</h2>
    <p>
      Prior to my current role, I workted at <a href="https://www.diva-e.com/de/">diva-e</a>, an
      agency where I gained my first professional experience as a Frontend Developer.
    </p>

    <h2>Stack</h2>
    <p>
      My current technology stack involves tools such as <a href="https://reactjs.org"
        >React with TypeScript</a
      >, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> itself, <a
        href="https://sass-lang.com">SCSS</a
      >, <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">StorybookJS</a> along with <a
        href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS with TypeScript</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my spare time, I explore other languages, technologies and frameworks. This website is
      built with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> for example.
    </p>

    <h2>Dev Tools</h2>
    <p>
      As an editor when I am working alone I mostly prefer working with <a
        href="https://github.com/nikbrunner/lazyvin">Neovim</a
      >, but I am also very proficient with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> and <a
        href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a
      >.

    <h2>Personal</h2>

    <p>Born in 1984, I am situated in Landshut, a charming city near Munich, Germany.</p>

    <p>
      Beyond my professional pursuits, I have made some <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/603Tahq6jn44VFj23DldSW">Music</a
      >
      in the past. I hold a deep reverence for nature that often translates into hiking, running, and
      meditation. During these sessions, I practice my love for <a
