**Application: Senior Frontend Engineer (Pass)**

Hi,

I've been a paying Proton user for over five years — starting with ProtonMail after watching Mr. Robot, and now using Mail, Calendar, Drive, and VPN daily. When I first got into programming, Proton was already on my list of dream companies. So this application has been a long time coming.

Professionally, I'm a Frontend Engineer with 5+ years of experience in React and TypeScript. At DealerCenter Digital, I spent five years building BikeCenter, an Electron-based point-of-sale application — relevant since the job posting mentions Electron as a bonus. I led the adoption of TanStack Query, migrated our codebase from legacy Redux, authored team-wide TypeScript guidelines, and built our custom design system with Storybook.

I should be honest: I still use 1Password. I've tried Pass, but after 10+ years with 1Password — especially now that I rely on its developer features for SSH keys and environment files — the switch hasn't happened yet. But that's exactly why I'd love to work on Pass: I know what a great password manager feels like, and I want to help build the one that finally makes me switch.

One thing I want to address upfront: I'm currently based in Germany. Relocating to Barcelona is something I'd seriously consider, but I'd need to understand the compensation and relocation support to make sure it works financially. I'd rather be transparent about this now than waste anyone's time.

Available from February 2026.
