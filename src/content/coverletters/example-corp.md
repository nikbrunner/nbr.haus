Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Frontend Engineer position at Example Corp. With over four years of professional experience building complex web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern frontend tooling, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your team.

In my current role at DealerCenter Digital, I have led the frontend development of enterprise-scale applications, including a comprehensive Electron-based dealer management system and a modern e-commerce storefront. I have demonstrated expertise in:

- Building and maintaining large-scale React applications with TypeScript
- Implementing custom design systems and component libraries
- Migrating legacy codebases to modern frameworks (React Router to TanStack Router)
- Working effectively in cross-functional teams with product and backend engineers

What excites me about Example Corp is your commitment to engineering excellence and user-focused product development. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work on challenging technical problems while contributing to a product that makes a real difference.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills align with your team's needs. Thank you for considering my application.
