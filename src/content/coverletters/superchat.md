**Application: Senior Frontend Engineer**

Hi,

I'm a Frontend Engineer with 5+ years of experience building React applications, and your tech stack caught my attention immediately — TypeScript, React, React-Query, Storybook, and TailwindCSS is essentially what I've been working with daily.

At DealerCenter Digital, I spent five years building and maintaining BikeCenter, an Electron-based point-of-sale application. I led the adoption of TanStack Query (React-Query), migrating from legacy Redux and authoring the team's code guidelines for query patterns and TypeScript best practices. I also built and maintained our custom design system with Storybook, and more recently migrated a Vendure storefront to TailwindCSS.

What I enjoy most is taking full ownership of features and translating designs into clean, type-safe code to shipping and iterating based on real usage. I care about code quality, but I care more about building things that actually work well for users.

I'm available from February 2026 and open to relocating to Berlin.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
