  greeting: "Hi there!",
  intro:
    "I'm <highlight>Nikolaus Brunner</highlight> (Nik for short), a Software Engineer based in Landshut, Germany, specializing in frontend architectures and design systems — {years} years in.",
  ux: "I have a strong sense for UX (user experience) and DX (developer experience). I love collaborating with designers or making design decisions independently.",
  independence:
    "I naturally identify priorities and manage my own work, but I also know when to reach out for input. Being part of a good team working towards a shared goal is where I thrive.",
  passion:
    "I genuinely love building and using products. I'm probably the guy who contacts support about features or bugs, and regularly checks changelogs and GitHub releases.",
  personal:
    "I was born in 1984. Outside of code I enjoy hiking, reading, landscape photography, music production, workflow optimization, and open source. Plus I have a slight keyboard obsession.",

    workflowInfo:
      "I am very passionate about workflow. You can check my <link>dotfiles here</link>.",
    aiIntro:
      "I entered the industry before AI became a thing, climbing the learning hill with no tab completion or ChatGPT.",
    aiLearning:
      "That foundation was invaluable, and still is. For juniors, AI shines as a teacher and reading partner for interactive learning, but not as a writing partner during the early phases. Without learning this craft the hard way first, I couldn't use AI as effectively as I do now.",
    aiLimitsInfo:
      "The technology is fascinating, but it has real limits. Relying too heavily on it means actively unlearning skills and knowledge, <highlight>and maybe most importantly, losing the fun</highlight>.",
    aiUsage:
      "That's why I'm deliberate about how I use it. I use <link>Claude Code</link> as my primary AI assistant. When the task feels manageable by AI code generation, I work out detailed plans and then let <link>Claude Code</link> handle the implementation, while reviewing the code step by step.",
