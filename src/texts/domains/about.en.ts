  greeting: "Hi there!",
  intro:
    "I'm <highlight>Nikolaus Brunner</highlight> (Nik for short), a Software Engineer based in Landshut, Germany, specializing in frontend architectures and design systems for {years} years now.",
  ux: "I have a strong sense for <strong>UX</strong> (user experience) and <strong>DX</strong> (developer experience). I love collaborating with designers or making design decisions independently.",
  independence:
    "I naturally identify priorities and manage my own work, but I also know when to reach out for input. Being part of a good team working towards a shared goal is what I enjoy most.",
  passion:
    "I <strong>genuinely love</strong> building and using products. I'm probably the guy who contacts support about features or bugs, and regularly checks changelogs and GitHub releases.",
  personal:
    "I was born in 1984, and outside of code I enjoy hiking, running, bouldering, cooking, reading, and photography. I also have a strong interest in design in all its forms, like architecture, art and typography... Plus I have a slight <strong>keyboard obsession</strong>.",
  iAnecdote:
    'I know that every sentence above (and this one) started with "I", but it felt absolutely awkward trying to speak about myself without using "I". :)',

    workflowInfo:
      "I am very passionate about workflow. You can check my <link>dotfiles here</link>.",
    aiIntro:
      "I entered the industry <strong>before AI</strong> became a thing. I climbed that hill without ChatGPT or tab completion.",
    aiLearning:
      "That foundation was invaluable, and still is. For juniors I think AI shines as a teacher and reading partner, but not as a writing partner during the early phases. I think it's important to learn to solve problems yourself and to also write down the solutions... or the attempts.",
    aiLimitsInfo:
      "The technology is fascinating, but it has real limits. Relying too heavily on it means actively unlearning skills and knowledge, <highlight>and maybe most importantly, losing the fun</highlight>.",
    aiUsage:
      "That's why I'm deliberate about how I use it. I use <link>Claude Code</link> as my primary AI assistant. I don't jump from model to model each week, but rather try to learn to get the most out of what I'm given. I think that for the last 1,5 years, Anthropic has built out the best integrations and DX for AI assistance.",
