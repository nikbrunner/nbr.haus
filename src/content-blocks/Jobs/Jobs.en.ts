    company: "DealerCenter Digital",
    position: "Software Engineer / Frontend Lead",
    period: "Sep 2020 – Jan 2026",
    p1: "I worked across the full spectrum of frontend development—from feature implementation and bug fixes to code reviews, mentoring, and cross-team coordination for a mature Electron application serving hundreds of bike retailers.",
    p2: "A major focus was architectural migrations: I championed TanStack Query adoption and migrated the codebase from legacy Redux to Redux Toolkit. This included authoring comprehensive code guidelines and best practices documentation. I also completely rebuilt a Vendure storefront from Remix to TanStack Start/Router with TanStack Query, Form, GraphQL, ShadCN and Tailwind CSS.",
    p3: "On the design system side, I created a comprehensive 10-variant color system with Figma integration, affecting 1.6k files across the codebase. BikeCenter's entire component library was built from scratch using React, TypeScript, and SCSS—no third-party UI frameworks.",
    p4: "Improving internal APIs and establishing developer experience patterns across the team were another focus. As a trusted decision-maker for UX and technical feasibility, I bridged design and engineering, collaborating with designers as both implementer and advisor.",
    p5: "Mentoring junior developers through pair programming and code reviews was another key part of the role. I established technical standards and conventions across the team, including translation guidelines, BEM naming, and TypeScript best practices, and served as a technical hub between management, backend, and frontend teams."
